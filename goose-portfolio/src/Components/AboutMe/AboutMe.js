      <p> ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Victoria, also known as Goose, a recently qualified Fullstack Software Developer.
      <br/>
<br/>
I've transitioned from a successful wine industry career to the world of tech, driven by a passion for creating innovative solutions. With a background in design, I relish crafting user experiences and bringing ideas to life through code. You might wonder why I swapped sipping Chardonnay in picturesque vineyards for code at my trusty PC? Well, I've always been passionate about *creating* things!
<br/>
<br/>
I'm the kind of person who sees problems as puzzles, and I love inventing imaginative (and often whimsical) solutions. With an entrepreneurial spirit and a knack for steering businesses toward innovation, I couldn't resist the allure of the tech world. I found my true calling in solving real-world problems through apps, guiding ideas from conception to fruition.
<br/>
<br/>
With a foundation in design, I adore crafting user-centric experiences. It's a thrilling journey, watching a seedling of an idea evolve into something extraordinary. From ideation and wireframing to breathing life into designs with the power of code â€“ every step is a joy.
