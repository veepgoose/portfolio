      <p> 👋 Hey there, I'm Victoria!

You know, life's a lot like a basket of colorful Easter eggs, and I'm here to crack the code to the sweetest ones! 🥚🌈
<br />
<br />
By day, I'm a dedicated Full Stack Developer, fresh out of The School of Code Bootcamp in Birmingham. But, my journey here has been a bit...eggstraordinary. 🐣
<br />
With a background in business management, I once ruled the wine world. 🍷🍇 Managing teams, navigating the wine business, and even dipping my toes into E-commerce, I've seen it all. I've got a knack for turning challenges sunny side up and creating delicious solutions.
<br />
<br />
Now, I'm on a quest to hatch imaginative app ideas into reality. Coding isn't just a job; it's a passion. And if you're in search of someone who's as passionate about coding as they are about perfecting a soufflé, well, you've found me! 🍳
<br />
I'm on the lookout for a company that's as forward-thinking as a space-age rocket ship and values creativity like it's the last chocolate egg on Easter morning. If that's you, let's scramble up some fresh ideas together! 🚀
<br />
<br />
When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, folding Origami that's more complex than a Rubik's Cube, and striking yoga poses that make pretzels jealous. I live for challenges and believe in constantly cracking the shell of new experiences.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for dropping by my pixelated corner of the web! Let's connect and see where our paths might cross—whether it's discussing code or sharing egg-citing stories.
